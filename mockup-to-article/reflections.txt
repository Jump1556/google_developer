You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:

  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  I can not say something was difficult, but it took time to realise how to submit answers with code.
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

  I learned few new tags as <hr>, <sup>, <figure>, <s>.
  I can not say something was difficult, but it took time to realise how to submit answers with code.
  I used forum for lesson 3 + I used MDN element reference for both lesson 3 and 4 + Google.
