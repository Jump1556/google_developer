I get paid to do what I love,

you not realize that being a good software developer doesn't necessarily require a computer science degree or years of work experience in the field. What it does require is dedication, a passion for programming and all things related to it, and a willingness to invest hours into exploring problems and seeing their solutions through to completion.

what programming languages I liked and disliked (and why)

They were more interested in whether or not I was the kind of person who would be interested and driven enough to learn to use them.

competence using the Unix/Linux command line

enthusiastic about trying new languages and frameworks

general coding competence. The bottom line is that if you don't demonstrate good coding habits

like patience, being able to work in a team, effective time management, and attention to detail are all skills that can help you do your job better
